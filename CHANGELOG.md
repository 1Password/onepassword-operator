# v1.6.0

This version of the operator highlights the migration of the operator 
to use the latest version of the `operator-sdk` (`1.25.0` at the time of this release).

For the users, this shouldn't affect the functionality of the operator. 

This migration enables us to use the new project structure, as well as updated packages that enables
the team (as well as the contributors) to develop the operator more effective.

## Features

## Fixes
 * The operator no longer logs an error about changing the secret type if the secret type is not actually being changed.
 * Annotations on a deployment are no longer removed when the operator triggers a restart. {#112}
